# Puppet Module to install a Sumo collector

This is an example of Sumo puppet module.  You will need to update the access ID/Key in the sumo.conf file.  Additionally, you can enabled other flags, ie: proxy or clobber.  Read the reference for more information.  You should also update/modify the sumo.json to include all your sources that you want to include as part of the install.

Have fun!
